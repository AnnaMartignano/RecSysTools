# RecSysTools

This repository contains the recommender algorithm classes and helper classes which perform pre-processing and evaluation metrics functions.  
All of them have been made available for the partecipants of the [Recommender System 2018 Challenge Polimi :trophy:](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recommender-system-2018-challenge-polimi/overview).  
The main repository made by Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema, PhD candidate at Politecnico di Milano, which contains a comprehensive overview could be found at this [link](https://github.com/MaurizioFD/RecSys_Course_2018).  
Here those files have been slightly modified in order to allow the kaggle notebooks used for the competition to download those files and create instance of those classes.
